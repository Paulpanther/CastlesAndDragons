Online Game to play with your friends.

### Install & Run

### Debugging

To test new assets, place them in `src/public/app/assets`.
To run both the Websocket Server and the Debug Server run `run.sh --debugStartWithGame`.
The Argument will start the Game when one player joins. 
If you want to test with multiple players, just run `run.sh` without arguments.  
**Warning:** Wait 2 minutes before restarting the Websocket Server 
(There is a bug which prevents the port from getting closed)
